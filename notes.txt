General notes
================================

1) Styling

I noticed you used a lot of row classes around col div's. Theres no need for the extra rows. You can apply the row class on the parent div,
and then inside, you can just use the col class and make the col sizing changes as you wish

2) Component placement

Within the recipe list folder, you have the recipe item and the recipe start component. What would be best is to move those 2 out the folder.
It was a bit confusing to find, and theres no need to add it within that folder.

3) File structure

To answer your question, the way you have done it is correct. Its important to remember that you will not be the only one to use, see or add
to the code. By adding correct file names, we can quickly find what we need. Theres a design pattern called chain of responsibility. It
basically states that certain behaviors and functions should be responsible for their own ability. By breaking up the components into its
own separate folders and modules, we allow for all behaviors in regards to said component to be solely within that component. That way if
there is anything to fix, we can know exactly where it is.

4) Functionality

In regards to the actual usage of the program, I would suggest to make more of a distinction between the adding, updating and deleting
functions. You used the same function for updating and adding in the shopping service. You also made it private. I would recommend
splitting the function into 2 functions for adding and updating, and making it public so you can use them within the components you are
using the shopping service
